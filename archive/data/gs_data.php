The centre has something for everyone, the 18-hole Rannaleroch Course and the 9-hole Leitfie Links, 10-bay covered floodlit golf range, golf academy and a friendly atmosphere in the clubhouse.</p>
		<p>The par 72, Rannaleroch course is set in undulating parkland with hundreds of mature trees, and fantastic views over the beautiful valley of Strathmore. Designed by John Salvesen, the Rannaleroch course has already been described as 'a Classic'. The generous greens are great targets, but their undulations make holing out a greater challenge than you might expect. With its generous fairways and rolling greens it is a challenge to low handicappers, yet forgiving for beginners.",
